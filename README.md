# Notes

This is a simple note taking application. A note has a text body and it can be marked as “archived”. They are displayed in a list or in a grid. Users can filter to show only “non-archived” (or active) notes and can sort notes according to their length in ascending (shortest first) or descending order (longest first). Users can create new notes and clear all existing ones.
