# Notes

This is a simple note taking application. 

A note 
- has a text body 
- can be marked as “archived”

Notes can be displayed in
- a list
- a grid

Users can 
- filter to show only “non-archived” (or active) notes
- sort notes according to their length in ascending (shortest first) or descending order (longest first)
- create new notes
- clear all existing ones.

Some enhancement ideas: (not implemented yet)
- Add an additional view.
- Allow for more sorting options.
- Add more properties / tags to notes than “archived”.
- Allow for note content to be edited.
- Allow a text file to be dragged onto the application to create a note. 
  Parse the content in the drag object to make a reasonable title and body for the note.
- Add a way to make some notes to-dos, then make a simple way to mark them as done. 
  Instead of deleting done to-do notes, hide them by default and make a way to show them.
